# CryptoCrazy-SwiftUI

This is an app which the users can get different crypto currencies. I created this app with SwiftUI and designed with MVVM design pattern. This app has a different coding style compared to Crypto-Crazy-SwiftUI which I uploaded before. In this app, I recoded the app by using async throws and try await. In that sense, this app is coded much more succinct and clear way than the previous one. To be able to get more information, you can read Crypto-Crazy-SwiftUI app read-me.
